## **Research Case Study** – Homework Assignment #1: Wealthsimple
**Overview and Origin**

Wealthsimple is a Toronto-based company that utilizes robo-advisors for investment management for beginner or novice investors regardless of their age, social economic status or educational background. Wealthsimple was founded by Michael Katchen and Rudy Adler in 2014. When Michael Katchen was a teenager when he discovered the ups and downs of investing. After self-picking stocks of MGI Software and Ballard shares, of which he lost almost all of his initial investment amount due to the dot com bubble burst and bankruptcy, he was exposed to the risk of investing in single stocks. Michael Katchen has contributed his own personal funding to Wealthsimple as well as also being funded by investors for upwards of C$266 million.

**Business Activities:**

Wealthsimple’s mission is that they are trying to make investing accessible and affordable for all Canadians – regardless of social economic status, education level, background or age. The company is targeted towards millennials, young adults, and Canadians with lower financially competency rates. Wealthsimple uses robo-advisors and have digitized the whole process of investing – all without human interaction – e.g. signing agreements, evaluating your personal risk profile, and picking stock/ investing on your behalf. Also, since they do not have the cost of salaries for various advisors – they can offer lower management fees. Wealthsimple’s main business technologies are Robo-Advisors and ETFs. Just recently, Wealthsimple Crypto launched – therefore extending their investing management to the markets of cryptocurrencies.

Investment Management is the domain of the financial industry that Wealthsimple operates in. The major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years that Wealthsimple has taken advantaged of a utilized to create their business is the automation of Investing with Robo-Advisors, and now the emergence of cryptocurrencies and crypto markets. Wealthsimple’s major competitors include: MoneyFarm, Axos Invest, iQuant and Nutmeg.
Results
Currently Wealthsimple has over C$5 Billion in assets under management due to the success of their robo-advisors and ETFs. Wealthsimple is now venturing into the crypto space by their recent launch of Wealthsimple Crypto. Some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success and how Wealthsimple is performing based on these metrics are:
1. Dollar amount of assets under management – over C$5 billion
2. Number of accounts under management – not published
3. Demographics of the accounts – e.g. age, geography, etc – not published
4. Average Return On Investment – not published
5. Financial literacy rate of Canada – e.g. Canada’s Financial Competency Survey – in 2014 Canada’s Financial literacy rate was 61%, since then only 40% of Canadians were able to increase their financial literacy rate.

**Recommendations**

Since Wealthsimple is mission-focused, with their mission is to increase the financial security of Canadians through increasing financial literacy, I would suggest more education services to increase the financial literacy of their customers. For example, Wealthsimple could partner with an education company to develop courses specifically targeted to young adults with lower levels financial knowledge.
This initiative would help in achieving their mission; to increase financial security. It would also provide their customers with the understanding of what Wealthsimple is doing behind the scenes to foster greater understanding and respect for what they do – also to justify the management fees (even though they are already extremely low). Wealhsimple would have to create a platform specifically for education purposes – whether its another website or API. They would also have to create lessons/ content (or partner with an education company) to teach their customers personal finance and investing. These technologies are appropriate because they are not extremely expensive options, and more importantly they tie into the mission of Wealthsimple.
